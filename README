This is a set of test and on-off apps experimenting w/ MSFT Azure Table Storage.
This uses only base-line C# (2.0) - no fancy SDKs. All done via HTTP request/response.

This is really early stuff. Likely it doesn't do what you want. Use it if you like, but don't complain.
Make it better and tell me all about it.
